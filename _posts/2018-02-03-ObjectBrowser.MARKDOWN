description: A proof-of-concept architectural object viewer in AR, based on Sheffield.

Building on the core tutorials in the [AR & Architecture](https://adamrtomkins.github.io/AR-Architecture) project, I have published a short guide on how to put together AR,Photogrammetry models, and some C# Coding to create a simple object viewer, with the ability to cycle through demonstrations.

You can find the source project on my [Github](https://github.com/AdamRTomkins/Ar-R-ObjBrowser), and checkout the accompanying tutorial over on  [AR & Architecture](https://adamrtomkins.github.io/AR-Architecture/ObjectBrowser/) if you want to follow along and create your own.
