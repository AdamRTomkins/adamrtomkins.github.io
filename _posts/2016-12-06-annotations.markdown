description: Opening up open data to the public
---

Open Science initiatives encourage labs to openly publish data to help accelerate research. Unfortunately, the released data is often hard to access and explore, requiring specialized software.  This limits the usage of data in education and online discussion, resulting in underutilized data and impoverished educational material. 

Imagine reading the latest research papers, revising online textbooks, or discussing controversial articles, with the ability view and explore and share the very latest scientific data as it is being unraveled.  This project will create the tools required to share and interact with the latest open data repositories, enabling embedded interactive data visualizations as rich content web-annotations.

Check out my latest [proposal](portfolio/Annotations/) on the projects page which aims to integrate web annotation into the heart of the Open Science movement by embedding data-annotation into the new FFBO data silo, while simultaneously creating a framework for other projects to follow suit. Why? Because open data should be open to everyone.
