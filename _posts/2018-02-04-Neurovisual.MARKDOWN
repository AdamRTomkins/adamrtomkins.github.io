description: Pretty natural scene generation for the drosophila retina model.

The Drosophila Retina is made up of tiling hexagonal photorecptors. As part of the Digital Fruit Fly Brain project, we are modelling the Drosophila retina, as the primary input to our deep-brain models. We can fun these models on flat image inputs and moving bars to demonstrate the information processing capabilites, but sometimes its worth see a more naturalistic stimuli.

Over on my [Github](https://github.com/AdamRTomkins/Neurovisual_Shader) you can see one interesting attempt at creating these inputs using Shaders in Unity, which look like this:
