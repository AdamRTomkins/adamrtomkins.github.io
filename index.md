I am a computational neuroscientist and neuroinformatic tool developer based in Sheffield, UK. I completed my PhD in Computer Science under <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/E.Vasilaki/" target="blank">Dr. Eleni Vasilaki</a> and <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/kevin-gurney" target="blank">Prof. Kevin Gurney</a>, and I am currently a neuroinformatic tool developer and Research Software Engineer on the <a href="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M025527/1" target="blank"> Digital Fruit Fly Brain</a> Project, with a Research Software Engineering Fellowship from the Sustainable Software Institute.

My research interests include connectomics, complexity, network science with large-network visualisation, with a passion for side projects with Virtual and Augmented Reality and Blockchain Development.

I'm currently experimenting with the 'Augmented Reality for Architecture' project.
