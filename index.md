I am a [Research Software Engineer](https://software.ac.uk/fellows/adam-tomkins) and [Neuroinformatic Tool Developer](https://neuronlp.fruitflybrain.org/) based in Sheffield, UK. I completed my PhD in Computer Science under <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/E.Vasilaki/" target="blank">Dr. Eleni Vasilaki</a>, and I am currently a Computational Neuroscientist on the <a href="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M025527/1" target="blank"> Digital Fruit Fly Brain</a> Project, with a Research Software Engineering Fellowship from the Sustainable Software Institute.

My research interests include connectomics, complexity, network science with large-network visualisation, with a passion for side projects with Virtual and Augmented Reality and Blockchain Development.

I'm currently experimenting with the [Augmented Reality for Architecture](http://adamrtomkins.github.io/AR-Architecture) project, and the spin-off [CityMesh](https://adamrtomkins.github.io/CityMesh/) project, looking at developing Augmented Reality technology in an Architecture setting, with emphisis on detailing to tools and techniques to get new developers started with AR.
